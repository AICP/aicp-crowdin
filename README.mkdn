crowdin_sync.py
==================

Introduction
------------
This script is forked and modified from LineageOS and used to synchronize AICP translations with Crowdin. Also, it can handle
automatic commiting to Gerrit and pushing/downloading to/from Crowdin.

Prerequisites
-------------
1. The (depreciated) Ruby variant of crowdin-cli >= 0.5.2 (see: https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli) is required for this to work.
   The following commands will install Ruby and the crowdin-cli version on your system:

    '\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

    source /home/your_username/.rvm/scripts/rvm # Add this to your .bashrc file for further usage!

    rvm all do gem install crowdin-cli'

2. python-git is used for Git integration and must be installed (also see: http://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html).

3. Copy /config/<AICP_version>_extra_packages.xml to .repo/local_manifests of each <AICP_version> tree.
   This makes sure you will sync all the extra packages not included in the main manifest.
   Please remember that you should comment out the packages you already have in your
   local aicp_manifest.xml file.

Executing
---------
Export the needed environment variables to set the API keys and the base path.
Base path should contain all AICP trees in subfolders, named after AICP branches.

Example:

'/home
    /username
        /aicp
            .gitreview      # gitreview config file
            /config         # yaml files directory
            /stable         # not necessary
            /n7.1
            /o8.0
            crowdin_sync.py # crowdin script file'

NOTE: Syncing stable trees requires an additional environment variable plus the 'stable'
subfolder under the base path (as shown above), due to crowdin API limitations.
As AICP has currently no stable branch, this setting should/could not be used.
Enviroment variables to export:

    export AICP_CROWDIN_API_KEY=aicp_api_key
    export AICP_CROWDIN_BASE_PATH=your_base_path
    #export AICP_CROWDIN_STABLE_BASE_PATH=your_stable_base_path

Example:

    export AICP_CROWDIN_API_KEY=9876543210ad4929df #AICP crowdin key available to managers
    export AICP_CROWDIN_BASE_PATH=~/aicp
    #export AICP_CROWDIN_STABLE_BASE_PATH=~/aicp/stable

Execute:
(the python script crowdin_sync.py and the *.yaml config directory should be copied into the base
folder structure, e.g. /home/username/aicp, like shown above)

    ./crowdin_sync.py --username your_gerrit_username --branch AICP_version [--upload-sources] [--upload-translations] [--download]

Bugs
----
 - When committing fails, the reason of it cannot be determined. Often this is just when there
   are no new translations, so the script will not exit when this happens!
